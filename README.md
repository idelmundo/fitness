  ## Project title 
  Fitness tracker 
  <hr>

  ## Description 
  As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
  In this app we made a fitness tracker were a user can select what type of exercise they would like to do. The following options are resistance and cardio, once these are filled we also have a fitness tracker dashboard were they can be see they're improvement weekly. Most challenging part was to going back to activities trying to understand my API routes.
